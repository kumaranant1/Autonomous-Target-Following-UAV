# Autonomous Aerial System: Dynamic Object/Target Tracking for Diverse Applications
## ABSTRACT :
This Proposal covers the approach to track an Object/Target through unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The primary focus of this project will be to develop a robust & efficient Object/Target tracking system so that the UAV (Drone) will be able to correctly detect & recognize an Object/Target and follow it wherever the Object/Target moves.
## GOALS :
* Checkpoint 1 
  - Detect Aruco Marker
  - Follow Aruco Marker, maintaining a fixed distance from it
  - Avoid Obstacles while following the Aruco Marker
---
* Checkpoint 2
  - Algorithm for Object/Target Detection 
  - Recognise and Lock the Target
  - Follow the specified Target if detected in the frame
  - Avoid Obstacles if encountered
## Timeline :
- 1 week: Detect Aruco Marker & Follow it
- 1 week : Avoid Obstacle while following Aruco Marker
- 2 week : Algorithms for object detection
- 2 week : Recognise, Lock, & Follow the target
- 2 week : Avoid Obstacle if encountered & Simulate every thing
